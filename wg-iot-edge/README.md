# IoT Edge Working Group

Identify and fix gaps in Kubernetes to better support IoT applications.

## Meetings
* Regular WG Meeting: [Fridays at 15:00 UTC](TBC) (bi-weekly). [Convert to your timezone](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=15:00&tz=UTC).
  * [Meeting notes and Agenda](TBC).

## Organizers

* Dejan Bosanac (**[@dejanb](https://github.com/dejanb)**), Red Hat

## Contact
* [Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/wg-iot-edge)
* [Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-wg-iot-edge)

## Goals

* Provide [reference architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_architecture) for various IoT/Edge environments based on
  * Size and Scale - 100s vs 1000s of edge compute nodes
  * Compute Substrate  - resource constrained worker nodes (mist compute) vs non-resource constrained worker nodes (edge/fog compute)
  * Network Topology
    * P2P edge environments vs Federated edge environments
    * Network-isolated edge environments (Network isolation is usually a security constraint in IoT/Edge environments)
* Evaluate and possibly extend k8s [federation infrastructure](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/multicluster/federation.md) (aka Ubernetes) to enable federation of multiple edge environments over bandwidth constrained and unreliable WAN interconnects.
* Evaluate and extend k8s network infrastructure to enable control plane communication over bandwidth constrained and unreliable WAN interconnects and in-edge data plane communication over unreliable wireless interconnects.
* Create and maintain conformance tests tailored towards performance and reliability requirements of most popular IIoT/Edge use cases.
* Build end-to-end PoCs to validate overall design and provide examples to system integrators.
* Evaluate and extend existing CLI tools to manage k8s clusters running in remote edge locations.

## Non-Goals

* Extend k8s network infrastructure to support IoT/M2M protocols for control plane communication.
* Provide OTA firmware/OS updates for edge compute nodes.
